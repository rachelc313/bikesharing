# NYC Citi Bike Presentation

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to use Tableau Public to provide and analysis of NYC bikesharing data to a hypothetical company looking to start a bikesharing program in Des Moines. The following questions were answered:
- What are the peak hours in August?
- What day of the week is the busiest and at what time of day?
- What gender is responsible for the busy check out times during those times?
- How long do most people check bikes out for?
- What gender checks out bikes the most and for how long?
- After determining what gender checks out bikes the most, break that down and find out gender as well as user type.
- Where are the most bikes checked out at?

## Summary
The analysis shows that males are responsible for the larger part of the bike checkouts. They typically occur on Thursdays between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM as well as 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM. The areas that have the most bike checkouts seem to be in areas of high tourism. Based on the heatmap comparing the user types, the majority of checkouts are done by subscribers.

### Two additional visualization suggestions for future analysis
- Gathering a dataset with the difference in profit from subscriber and customer to determine if there is a reason to try to incentivize more subscriptions. A line graph could be made to compare the two side by side. 
- A graph or chart could be made with the loss of income from bikes not being returned to an ending station. A map could be made for where they are typically found (if not returned). This could be helpful in determining new end station locations or if any need to be removed or moved.
